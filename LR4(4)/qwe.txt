Bowie was born in Brixton, south London. His mother, Margaret Mary "Peggy" (nee Burns), from Kent,[4] worked as a waitress,[5] while his father, Haywood Stenton "John" Jones, from Yorkshire,[6] was a promotions officer for the children's charity Barnardo's. The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road, near the border of the south London areas of Brixton and Stockwell. Bowie attended Stockwell Infants School until he was six years old, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child—and a defiant brawler.[7]
