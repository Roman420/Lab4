The 1960s were not a happy period for Bowie, who remained a struggling artist, awaiting his breakthrough. 
He finally achieved his commercial breakthrough in 1969 with the song "Space Oddity," which was released at the time of the moon landing. 
He dabbled in many different styles of music (without commercial success), and other art forms such as acting, mime, painting, and playwriting. 
Despite the fact that the literal meaning of the lyrics relates to an astronaut who is lost in space, this song was used by the BBC in their coverage of the moon landing, and this helped it become such a success.
